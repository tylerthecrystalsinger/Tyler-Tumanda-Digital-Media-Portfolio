<p> Hello! It's a Me Mario. Luigi i'm calling you because I'm going, to need your help tomorrow It seems that Bowser, he kidnapped Peach He took her to his castle, and I need your help to defeat him We get a Yoshi, to eat the turtles But if we lose him eat a mushroom to get bigger so they cant hurt us Or get the feather, so you can fly I found the flower power, no more mister nice guy I'm so tired, of dodging smiling bullets and footballs But for princess Peach I will destroy it all And Bowser you can run and hide! But when I jump on you three times! It will all be over, you'll blow up and die And I save my princess, you will never survive Cause i made it past all the ghosts I killed the turtles and their bones I destroyed the wizard who was riding the clouds And all of these flying, came tumbling down, to the ground My princess, I will find you And I don't care who i have-a to fight, or what i have-a to jump on Or if I have to down the green-a pipes, or swim across-a the blue ocean, or swim under the water, and fight the fish I will do all this, because I love you Let's a go!</p>
